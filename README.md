Applescripts to Rename JS in SubFolders Up to 2 Levels Deep for Import into Quiver

Created this combination of Applescripts and Automator workflows to rename Javascript files created with Visual Studio Code as .txt files so I could import them into the [Quiver](http://happenapps.com/) notetaking app.

Assumes you have a folder, let's call it 'Javscript Examples' that has inside it Javascript files and other folders that contain Javascript files, and some of those folders also have folders that contain Javascript files.

First put your _'Javscript Examples'_ folder inside a "Parent Folder".  Then manually run these scripts against that parent folder, 1 at a time.
